# Introduction

Remember the "Windows Color and Appearance" section in Windows 7 control panel?

Sadly if you are in Windows 10 or higher, this is no longer available.

However, it is still possible to alter these values through regedit.

# Registry Colors Editor - Windows Color and Appearance, Revived

I've started development on a program that allows you to change these values with a colorpicker.
It is currently in early stages of development.


# Current Features

- You may set an option to the selected color with the "Set" button

- You may reset this option to its default color value


# Upcoming Features

- Visual examples to clarify what you're changing

- "Reset all" button

# Notes

This program is not complete. It works, but you need to either reboot or relog your computer for the changes to come into effect. Make sure you know what the setting does before you change it.

# Why did I make this program?

I know it doesn't seem like much currently, but I made this mostly as a proof to myself. I don't know how much I will actually use it, but it's more of a proof of concept of registry editing with C#. I also figured out how to include dependencies (in this case, the ColorPicker) in a single .exe file (creating a portable app), which is something I struggled with in my past programs.

I hope to expand this tool into something that's actually useful, instead of the way it currently is (a skeleton of what it will be).

I upload it here because maybe someone can get use out of it!
